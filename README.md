## Introduction
This was a training project I created using the React Javascript library. I followed a tutorial guiding me through how to use React hooks, and this project is the result of following that tutorial. The different hooks in the project change the title of the browser page/text on the page depending on user input, show the current size of the browser page, and grabs a list of users from an api
